This script will run a flask webserver to query and display a specified set of computers about their logged in users. The webpage displays the status of the computers and can additionally display a staticly set list of software for the set of computers, as well as generate RDP files to connect to the computers for ease of access. 

The Script uses the pip packages tabulate and flask. Additionally, to make the webpage look nice and work offline, Twitters Bootstrap project has been used for the webpages.
The files are missing here but can be downloaded from the projects website and are expected to be in "static/bootstrap".
