# Collection of useful scripts and configurations
This little collection build up over the years I was employed as a helping hand of an IT Administrator. The collection has been stripped of personal or specific files and may need some adjustment if you want to use them. Most of the scripts are written in Python for rapid prototyping reasons.

In the collection are the following tools:
- Web scraping of parking lot availability
- Webservice for displaying colleagues internal phone numbers
- Finding and reporting folders over 40GB or with more than 6 months without modification
- Geocode adresses to Long:Lat or vice versa via Google Maps API
