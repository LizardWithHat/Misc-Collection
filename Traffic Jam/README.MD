This script uses publicy available traffic data from the [web resource of Nordrhine-Westphalias open data portal](https://ckan.open.nrw.de/dataset/verkehrsinformationen_der_viz_nrw_f__r_nordrhein_westfalen_1568186868) to collect data on specific routes about official traffic jam announcements. To do so the first script, filter_traffic.py, filters all locally saved raw data xml files to fit the specified zones and cut down on file sizes. The second script then can process the XML data to CSV files to be able to use them in other programs such as Excel.
