This tool helps you to determine the height difference of a distance between two points.
The tool asks for two altitudes/latitudes, as well as the number of intermediate points.
Pre-entered are the points for our office and for the city of Bielefeld.
The intermediate points contain the start and end point, so a value of at least 2 is required.
After clicking OK the query is started. If the query is completed successfully, you will be asked where to save the result.
The result is a CSV file that can be imported into Excel.
Do not open it directly with Excel, because the numbers will be misinterpreted this way.
