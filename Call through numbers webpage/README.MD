This Python script creates a simple Webpage via Flask that reads the "durchwahlliste.csv" file and pretty prints the results of it.
This happens dynamically every time the page is loaded, so modifications don't require restarting the script.

Twitter's Bootstrap was used in this little project and served locally. The files are missing here, but can be downloaded at the projects webpage. They are expected at "static/bootstrap/".
